Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe! This is a Java console-based game where you can play against another player or against the computer.
How to Play

    Setup: Make sure you have Java installed on your system.

    Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

     git clone <repository-url>

Compile the Code: Navigate to the src directory of the repository and compile the Java source files using the javac command:

javac Main.java

Run the Game: After successfully compiling the code, run the game using the java command:

java Main

    Game Modes:
        Two Players: When prompted, enter the positions to place your 'X' or 'O' on the game board. The game will alternate between Player 1 ('X') and Player 2 ('O').
        Against CPU: Choose to play against the computer. The computer will make its moves automatically, and you'll play as 'X'.

    Winning the Game: The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.

    Enjoy the Game!
